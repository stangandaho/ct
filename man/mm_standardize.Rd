\description{
This function standardizes a given data matrix using different methods such as
total sum scaling, max normalization, frequency scaling, standardization,
presence-absence transformation, chi-square transformation,
Hellinger transformation, log transformation, and others.
}
\details{
The function provides the following standardization methods for community data:

\itemize{
\item \code{"total"}: Divides by margin total (default \code{margin = 1}).
\item \code{"max"}: Divides by margin maximum (default \code{margin = 2}).
\item \code{"frequency"}: Divides by margin total and multiplies by the
number of non-zero items, ensuring the average of non-zero entries is one
(Oksanen 1983; default \code{margin = 2}).
\item \code{"normalize"}: Scales data so that the sum of squares along the
specified margin equals one (default \code{margin = 1}).
\item \code{"range"}: Standardizes values into the range \code{[0,1]} (default \code{margin = 2}).
If all values are constant, they will be transformed to 0.
\item \code{"rank"}, \code{"rrank"}:
\itemize{
\item \code{"rank"} replaces abundance values by their increasing ranks, leaving zeros unchanged.
\item \code{"rrank"} is similar but uses relative ranks with a maximum of 1 (default \code{margin = 1}).
}
\item \code{"standardize"}: Scales \code{x} to zero mean and unit variance (default \code{margin = 2}).
\item \code{"pa"}: Converts \code{x} to presence/absence scale (0/1).
\item \code{"chi.square"}: Divides by row sums and the square root of column sums,
then adjusts for the square root of the matrix total (Legendre & Gallagher 2001).
When used with Euclidean distance, the distances should be similar to Chi-square
distances in correspondence analysis (default \code{margin = 1}).
\item \code{"hellinger"}: Computes the square root of \code{method = "total"} (Legendre & Gallagher 2001).
\item \code{"log"}: Logarithmic transformation suggested by Anderson et al. (2006):
\deqn{\log_b (x) + 1}{log_b (x) + 1} for \eqn{x > 0}, where \eqn{b} is the base of the logarithm.
Zeros remain unchanged. Higher bases give less weight to quantities and more to presences.
\item \code{"alr"}: Additive log ratio (ALR) transformation (Aitchison 1986).
Reduces skewness and compositional bias. Requires positive values; pseudocounts can be added.
The transformation is defined as:
\deqn{alr = [\log(x_1 / x_D), ..., \log(x_{D-1} / x_D)]}{alr = [log(x_i/x_D), ..., log(x_{-D}/x_D)]}
where the denominator sample \eqn{x_D} can be chosen arbitrarily.
\item \code{"clr"}: Centered log ratio (CLR) transformation (Aitchison 1986).
Common in microbial ecology (Gloor et al. 2017). Only supports positive data;
pseudocounts can be used to handle zeros. The transformation is defined as:
\deqn{clr = \log(x / g(x)) = \log x - \log g(x)}{clr = log(x/g(x)) = log x - log g(x)}
where \eqn{x} is a single value, and \eqn{g(x)} is the geometric mean of \eqn{x}.
\item \code{"rclr"}: Robust CLR transformation. Unlike CLR, this method allows zeros
without requiring pseudocounts. It divides values by the geometric mean of
observed (non-zero) features, preserving zeros (Martino et al. 2019). The transformation is defined as:
\deqn{rclr = \log(x / g(x > 0))}{rclr = log(x/g(x > 0))}
where \eqn{x} is a single value, and \eqn{g(x > 0)} is the geometric mean
of sample-wide values \eqn{x} that are positive (\eqn{x > 0}).
}

Standardization, as contrasted to transformation, means that the
entries are transformed relative to other entries.

All methods have a default margin. \code{margin=1} means rows
(sites in a normal data set) and \code{margin=2} means columns (species in a
normal data set).

Command \code{wisconsin} is a shortcut to common Wisconsin double
standardization where species (\code{margin=2}) are first standardized
by maxima (\code{max}) and then sites (\code{margin=1}) by
site totals (\code{tot}).

Most standardization methods will give nonsense results with
negative data entries that normally should not occur in the community
data. If there are empty sites or species (or constant with
\code{method =  "range"}), many standardization will change these into
\code{NaN}.

Function \code{decobackstand} can be used to transform standardized
data back to original. This is not possible for all standardization
and may not be implemented to all cases where it would be
possible. There are round-off errors and back-transformation is not
exact, and it is wise not to overwrite the original data. With
\code{zap=TRUE} original zeros should be exact.

\note{
This function is adapted from the \code{decostand} function in the \code{vegan} R package,
with modifications to improved handling.
