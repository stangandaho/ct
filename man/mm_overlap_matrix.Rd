\usage{
mm_overlap_matrix(
  data,
  species_column,
  time_column,
  convert_time = F,
  format = "\%H:\%M:\%S",
  fill_na = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{tibble} containing species and time information.}

\item{species_column}{A column in \code{data} indicating species names.}

\item{time_column}{A column in \code{data} containing time data (either as radians or in a time format to be converted).}

\item{convert_time}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the time data will be converted to radians using the \code{mm_to_radian} function.}

\item{format}{A character string specifying the time format (e.g., \code{"\%H:\%M:\%S"}) if \code{\link[=mm_to_radian]{mm_to_radian()}} is \code{TRUE}. Defaults to \code{"\%H:\%M:\%S"}.}

\item{fill_na}{Optional. A numeric value used to fill \code{NA} values in the overlap coefficient matrix. Defaults to \code{NULL} (does not fill \code{NA} values).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[overlap:overlapEst]{overlap::overlapEst()}}` for overlap estimation.}
}
\value{
A square matrix of pairwise overlap coefficients, where rows and columns represent species.
}
\description{
This function calculates pairwise overlap coefficients for activity patterns of multiple species
using their time data.
}
\details{
The function calculates pairwise overlap coefficients for all species in the dataset.
The overlap coefficients are estimated using the \code{overlap} package:
\itemize{
\item For species pairs with sample sizes of at least 50 observations each, the \code{Dhat4} estimator is used.
\item For smaller sample sizes, the \code{Dhat1} estimator is used (Schmid & Schmidt, 2006).

# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  species = c("SpeciesA", "SpeciesA", "SpeciesB", "SpeciesB"),
  time = c("10:30:00", "11:45:00", "22:15:00", "23:30:00")
)

# Calculate overlap coefficients with time conversion
overlap_matrix <- mm_overlap_matrix(
  data = data,
  species_column = species,
  time_column = time,
  convert_time = TRUE,
  format = "\%H:\%M:\%S"
)

# Fill missing values in the matrix with 0
overlap_matrix_filled <- mm_overlap_matrix(
  data = data,
  species_column = species,
  time_column = time,
  convert_time = TRUE,
  fill_na = 0
)
