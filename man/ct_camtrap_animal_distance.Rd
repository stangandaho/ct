\title{Estimate distance from camera trap to animal}
\usage{
ct_camtrap_animal_distance(fov, forward_distance, ref_halfwidth, animal_offset)
}
\arguments{
\item{fov}{Numeric. The camera's horizontal field of view in degrees.
Common values range from 30° to 60° depending on camera model.}

\item{forward_distance}{Numeric. The forward distance (in meters) from the camera to the
animal along the central axis, estimated using reference markers visible
in the image.}

\item{ref_halfwidth}{Numeric. The measured half-width of the camera's field of view
in the image at distance \code{forward_distance}, in any unit (e.g., cm, pixels). This is
typically measured with a ruler on the photo or using image analysis software.}

\item{animal_offset}{Numeric. The measured horizontal offset of the animal from the
central vertical line in the image, in the same units as \code{ref_halfwidth}.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The estimated radial distance (in meters) from the camera
to the animal.
}
\description{
Calculates the radial distance between a camera trap and an animal detected
in an image using geometric principles and reference markers.

\examples{
distance <- ct_camtrap_animal_distance(
  fov = 35,
  forward_distance = 7.5,
  ref_halfwidth = 12,
  animal_offset = 3
)
