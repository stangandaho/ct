\title{Calculate Observed Spatial Coverage of Species}
\usage{
mm_spatial_coverage(
  data,
  site_column,
  size_column = NULL,
  longitude,
  latitude,
  crs = c(4326, NULL),
  study_area = NULL,
  resolution,
  spread_factor = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing species occurrence records, including site, longitude, latitude, and optionally size (abundance).}

\item{site_column}{Column name specifying the site identifier.}

\item{size_column}{Optional column specifying the abundance of species at each site.
Defaults to NULL, in which case counts per site are used.}

\item{longitude}{Column name specifying the longitude of observation sites.}

\item{latitude}{Column name specifying the latitude of observation sites.}

\item{crs}{A vector of length two specifying the coordinate reference systems: \code{c(crs1, crs2)}.
\itemize{
\item \code{crs1} represents the current CRS of the data (e.g., 4326 for latitude/longitude).
\item \code{crs2} represents the CRS to transform into (e.g., "EPSG:32631", a UTM EPSG code) for accurate distance calculations.
If \code{crs2} is NULL, no transformation is applied. Defaults to \code{c(4326, NULL)}
}}

\item{study_area}{An optional simple feature (sf) polygon representing the study area. If provided, the raster extends to cover the area.}

\item{resolution}{Numeric value specifying the spatial resolution (grid size) for rasterization.}

\item{spread_factor}{A scale factor for the half-normal distribution.
Higher values create a more spread-out distribution, while lower values make
it more concentrated. The value must be in ]0; 1]}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Coverage raster}: A raster object representing species abundance across space.
\item \strong{Coverage stats}: A tibble with spatial coverage statistics, including area (kmÂ²), average abundance, maximum abundance, and standard deviation.
}

\description{
This function calculates the \emph{Observed Spatial Coverage} of a species like \emph{Home Range},
but based on camera trap data.
The term home range is typically associated with dynamic movement data, such as
those recorded by radio-tracking or GPS devices, which provide continuous or
near-continuous tracking of an individual animal's movements. Since camera traps
are static and only capture presence/absence or activity within their specific
locations, the concept of home range might not fully apply.
}
\details{
The function applies a half-normal kernel to model species abundance over space,
using the scale rate to control the spread of the distribution:

\deqn{\bar{K}(x) = \frac{\sum w * \text{e}^{(-0.5 * (\frac{x}{\sigma})^2)}}{N}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\bar{K}(x)} is the mean abundance kernel across all sites,
\item \eqn{w} is the species abundance at each site,
\item \eqn{\sigma} is the standard deviation of the spatial distance (scaled by spread_factor),
\item \eqn{N} is the total number of sites.
