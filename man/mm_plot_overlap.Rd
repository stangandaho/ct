\arguments{
\item{A}{A numeric vector of time-of-day observations (in radians) for species A.}

\item{B}{A numeric vector of time-of-day observations (in radians) for species B.}

\item{xscale}{A numeric value to scale the x-axis. Default is \code{24} for representing time in hours.}

\item{xcenter}{A string indicating the center of the x-axis. Options are \code{"noon"} (default) or \code{"midnight"}.}

\item{n_grid}{An integer specifying the number of grid points for density estimation. Default is \code{128}.}

\item{kmax}{An integer indicating the maximum number of modes allowed in the activity pattern. Default is \code{3}.}

\item{adjust}{A numeric value to adjust the bandwidth of the kernel density estimation. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{rug}{A logical value indicating whether to include a rug plot of the observations. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{overlap_color}{A string specifying the color of the overlap area. Default is \code{"gray40"}.}

\item{overlap_alpha}{A numeric value (0 to 1) for the transparency of the overlap area. Default is \code{0.8}.}

\item{linetype}{A vector of integers specifying the line types for species A and B density lines. Default is \code{c(1, 2)}.}

\item{linecol}{A vector of strings specifying the colors of the density lines for species A and B. Default is \code{c("gray10", "gray0")}.}

\item{linewidth}{A vector of numeric values specifying the line widths for species A and B density lines. Default is \code{c(1, 1)}.}

\item{overlap_only}{A logical value indicating whether to plot only the overlap region without individual density lines. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{rug_lentgh}{A numeric value specifying the length of the rug ticks. Default is \code{0.018} (in normalized plot coordinates).}

\item{rug_color}{A string specifying the color of the rug ticks. Default is \code{"gray30"}.}

\item{extend}{A string specifying the color of the extended area beyond the activity period. Default is \code{"lightgrey"}.}

\item{extend_alpha}{A numeric value (0 to 1) for the transparency of the extended area. Default is \code{0.8}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{geom_rug} function.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the activity density curves and overlap between the two species.
If \code{overlap_only = TRUE}, only the overlap region is displayed.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the temporal overlap between two species' activity patterns based on time-of-day data.
It uses kernel density estimation to estimate activity densities and highlights areas of overlap between the two species.
}
\details{
This function calculates kernel density estimates for two sets of time-of-day data (\code{A} and \code{B})
and visualizes their overlap. The time-of-day data should be expressed in radians (0 to 2Ï€).

Key features of the plot:
\itemize{
\item The x-axis can be scaled to represent hours (default \code{xscale = 24}) or other units.
\item The center of the x-axis can be adjusted to \code{"noon"} or \code{"midnight"}.
\item A shaded polygon highlights the overlap region between the two density curves.
\item Optionally includes a rug plot to indicate raw observations.
\item Allows customization of line types, colors, widths, and transparency.
\item Extended regions (beyond the primary activity period) can be highlighted for clarity.

\dontrun{
  # Generate random data for two species
  set.seed(42)
  species_A <- runif(100, 0, 2 * pi)
  species_B <- runif(100, 0, 2 * pi)

  # Plot overlap with default settings

  # Customize plot with specific colors and line types
  mm_plot_overlap(A = species_A, B = species_B, overlap_color = "blue", linecol = c("red", "green"))

  # Include rug plots and change transparency
  mm_plot_overlap(A = species_A, B = species_B, rug = TRUE, overlap_alpha = 0.5)
