Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index measure diversity takes account species richness evenness, introduced Claude Shannon 1948. Commonly referred Shannon's Diversity Index, based concept uncertainty. instance, community low diversity, high level certainty (low uncertainty) identity randomly selected organism. Conversely, highly diverse community, uncertainty increases, making harder predict species randomly chosen organism belong (low certainty high uncertainty). $$H = -\\sum_{=1}^{S} p_{} * \\ln p_{}$$ \\(p_{}\\) = proportion individuals species , ln natural logarithm,  S = species richness. value H ranges 0 Hmax.

Pielou Evenness diversity index Species evenness refers relative abundance species within environment. example, 40 foxes 1000 dogs, community uneven one species dominates. However, 40 foxes 42 dogs, community much even, species balanced number. degree evenness community can quantified using Pielou's evenness index (Pielou, 1966): $$J=\\frac{H}{H_{\\max }}$$ value J ranges 0 1. Higher values indicate higher levels evenness. maximum evenness, J = 1. J D can used measures species dominance (opposite diversity) community.
