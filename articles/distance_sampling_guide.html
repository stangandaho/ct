<h3 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h3>
<p>Distance sampling represents a fundamental advance in wildlife
population estimation, addressing one of ecology’s most persistent
challenges: accounting for imperfect detection. Originally developed in
the early 1990s for line and point transect surveys conducted by human
observers, this method has recently been adapted for camera trap
studies. The core innovation of distance sampling lies in its ability to
correct density estimates by explicitly modeling how detection
probability decreases with distance from the observer.</p>
<p>Traditional wildlife surveys face a limitation: not all animals
present in a study area are observed. Animals farther from an observer
or survey line are progressively more likely to be missed. Distance
sampling confronts this issue directly by measuring the perpendicular
distance between detected animals and survey points or lines, then using
these measurements to estimate the probability of detection as a
function of distance. This detection function allows us to extrapolate
from observed animals to the total population, accounting for those
individuals that were present but undetected.</p>

<h4 id="traditional-point-transect-surveys">Traditional Point Transect Surveys<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#traditional-point-transect-surveys"></a>
</h4>
<p>In conventional point transect distance sampling, a human observer
stands at a fixed location for a brief moment and records all animals
detected within their field of view, along with the distance to each
animal. The observer then moves to the next point, repeating this
process across the study area. This approach assumes that detection
probability is perfect at the point itself (distance zero) and decreases
with increasing distance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-camera-trap-adaptation">The Camera Trap Adaptation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-camera-trap-adaptation"></a>
</h4>
<p>Camera traps share fundamental similarities with human point transect
surveys. Both methods record animals from a fixed point in space,
creating a snapshot of detections at specific moments. However, camera
traps introduce important differences (see Figure 1) that required
modification of the traditional distance sampling framework.</p>
<p>Where a human observer samples a point for mere seconds and typically
visits only once or a few times, a camera trap samples continuously for
days, weeks, or months. Human observers can pivot 360° around a point,
whereas cameras remain fixed, sampling only a fraction of a circle
determined by their viewshed angle (e.g 45°, less than 180°). These
differences necessitated the incorporation of temporal and spatial
effort components into the camera trap distance sampling model.</p>

<h4 id="basic-density-equation">Basic Density Equation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-density-equation"></a>
</h4>
<p>The camera trap distance sampling model builds upon the traditional
distance sampling equation but incorporates the unique characteristics
of camera trap surveys. The fundamental equation for estimating density
is:</p>
<p><strong>D = N / (πw² × e × p̂)</strong></p>
<p>In this equation, <strong>N</strong> represents the total number of
detection events recorded across all cameras, <strong>w</strong> is the
truncation distance beyond which detections are excluded from analysis,
<strong>e</strong> quantifies the sampling effort (see section below for
detail), and <strong>p̂</strong> estimates the probability of detecting
an animal within the truncation distance.</p>
<p>The truncation distance serves an important purpose. Beyond a certain
distance, detection becomes highly uncertain and including these distant
observations can introduce bias. We typically examine the distribution
of detection distances and choose a truncation point that balances
retaining sufficient data while excluding unreliable distant detections.
The recommended truncation is 2-15m <span class="citation">(Howe et al.
2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Concerning <strong>p̂</strong>, it is the total detection probability
within the study area. As we will see later, it is the area under the
curve of the detection function. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} =
\int_{r_{min}}^{r_{max}} g(r)\, dr\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r_{min}\)</span> is the left truncation distance
(minimum distance), and <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span> is
the right truncation distance (maximum distance).</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="understanding-sampling-effort">Understanding Sampling Effort<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#understanding-sampling-effort"></a>
</h4>
<p>Sampling effort for camera traps requires careful consideration of
both temporal and spatial dimensions. A camera operating for longer
periods accumulates more sampling effort, as does a camera with a wider
field of view.</p>
<p><img src="cameratrap_effort_formula.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;"></p>
<p>The effort equation captures this: <span class="math inline">\(e =
\frac{\theta \times T}{2\pi \times t}\)</span></p>
<p>Here <strong>T</strong> represents the total time the camera was
operational and actively sampling, <strong>θ</strong> denotes the
camera’s viewshed angle in radians (the horizontal extent of its field
of view), and <strong>t</strong> is a predetermined time interval at
which animal-camera distances are measured. The denominator 2π
represents a full circle, so the fraction θ/(2π) expresses what
proportion of a complete circle the camera samples.</p>
<p>The time interval <strong>t</strong> deserves particular attention.
For each detection event, researchers must measure the distance between
camera and animal at regular intervals throughout the time animals
remain visible. If animals move quickly or are rare, smaller intervals
(0.25 to 3 seconds) provide more accurate distance measurements. This
interval effectively determines how many “snapshots” are taken of each
detection event.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-detection-function">The Detection Function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-detection-function"></a>
</h4>
<p>Central to distance sampling is the detection function, which models
how detection probability declines with increasing distance from the
camera. This function must satisfy a critical assumption: detection
probability equals one at distance zero. In other words, an animal
directly in front of the camera is always detected.</p>
<p>The detection function typically takes one of several mathematical
forms, each characterized by a key function that describes the general
shape of detection probability decline. The most commonly used key
functions are the half-normal and hazard-rate models.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="the-half-normal-key-function">The Half-Normal Key Function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-half-normal-key-function"></a>
</h5>
<p>The half-normal key function assumes that detection probability
decreases following a bell-curve shape (without the ascending portion).
It contains a single scale parameter <em>σ</em> that determines how
quickly detection probability falls off with distance. When detection
probability drops relatively uniformly with distance, the half-normal
often provides a good fit.</p>
<p><img src="half_normal_probability_density_function.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The half-normal key function is <span class="math inline">\(\exp\!\left(-\frac{r^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)\)</span>
where <em>r</em> is the camera-animal distances. Note that it is called
Half-normal because it considers one part (here, the right-hand side) of
a normal distribution. With this function, any negative distance leads
to zero detection probability. At a distance close to zero, the
probability is close to 1. As the distance increases, the detection
probability decreases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="the-hazard-rate-key-function">The Hazard-Rate Key Function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-hazard-rate-key-function"></a>
</h5>
<p>The hazard-rate key function offers more flexibility through both
scale and shape parameters. This function can accommodate situations
where detection probability remains relatively high across moderate
distances before dropping more steeply at greater distances. The shape
parameter controls this characteristic shoulder in the detection curve.
The Hazard-rate key function is <span class="math inline">\(1-
\exp\!\left(-(\frac{r}{\sigma^{2}})^{-b}\right)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is function-specific parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="the-uniform-key-function">The Uniform Key Function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-uniform-key-function"></a>
</h5>
<p>Less commonly used, the uniform key function assumes constant
detection probability across all distances up to the truncation point.
This function serves primarily as a baseline and typically requires
adjustment terms to provide realistic fits to data. The uniform key
function is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{w}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> the truncation distances.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="adjustment-terms">Adjustment Terms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adjustment-terms"></a>
</h4>
<p>Real-world detection data rarely follows the smooth curves of
theoretical key functions perfectly. Animals may be more or less
detectable at certain distances due to vegetation structure, terrain, or
behavior. Adjustment terms allow the detection function to flex and
accommodate these departures from the idealized key function shape.</p>
<p>Three types of adjustment terms are available: cosine, Hermite
polynomial, and simple polynomial. These mathematical functions add
bumps and wiggles to the basic key function curve, improving the fit to
observed data. Each adjustment term is characterized by its order, which
determines the complexity of the added flexibility.</p>
<p>Cosine adjustments represent the most commonly used approach. When
applied to half-normal or hazard-rate key functions, cosine adjustments
of orders 2, 3, 4 and higher can be sequentially added. For a uniform
key function, orders begin at 1. The adjustment terms are scaled by the
truncation distance, ensuring they remain appropriately sized relative
to the sampling range.</p>
<p>Hermite polynomial adjustments offer an alternative, though they
restrict flexibility by allowing only even orders (2, 4, 6, and so on).
Simple polynomial adjustments follow the same even-order restriction.
The choice among adjustment types typically makes less difference than
whether adjustments are included at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="model-selection-through-aic">Model Selection Through AIC<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-selection-through-aic"></a>
</h4>
<p>When adjustment terms are considered, we face the question of how
many to include. Too few adjustments may fail to capture important
features of the detection process, while too many can lead to
overfitting and implausible detection functions. The Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) provides a principled approach to this selection
problem.</p>
<p>The AIC balances model fit against complexity, penalizing additional
parameters. Distance sampling software typically implements a sequential
forward selection procedure. It begins with a key function alone,
calculates the AIC, then adds adjustment terms one at a time. If adding
an adjustment improves (lowers) the AIC, it is retained. The process
continues until adding further adjustments fails to improve the AIC, at
which point the previous model is selected as optimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="ensuring-monotonicity">Ensuring Monotonicity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ensuring-monotonicity"></a>
</h4>
<p>A fundamental biological reality dictates that detection probability
cannot increase with distance from the camera. Yet when adjustment terms
are added to detection functions, the resulting curve may develop
unrealistic humps where detection probability rises at greater distances
before falling again. Monotonicity constraints address this problem.</p>
<p>Two levels of monotonicity enforcement are possible. Weak
monotonicity requires that detection probability at any distance be less
than or equal to detection probability at distance zero. Strict
monotonicity imposes a stronger requirement: detection probability must
decrease (or at minimum remain constant) at each point compared to the
previous shorter distance. Strict monotonicity represents the more
biologically realistic assumption and is typically applied by default
when fitting models without covariates.</p>
<p>These constraints operate during model fitting by evaluating
detection probability at regularly spaced points across the distance
range. If the constraints are violated, the optimization algorithm
adjusts parameters to satisfy them. However, monotonicity constraints
cannot be enforced when covariates are included in the model, as
detection probability may legitimately vary in complex ways across
different covariate values.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-activity-level-correction">The Activity Level Correction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-activity-level-correction"></a>
</h4>
<p>Many species exhibit predictable periods of inactivity when they are
unavailable for detection. Nocturnal species rest during daylight hours,
while diurnal species are inactive at night. Some species have regular
midday rest periods even during their active season. If camera data
includes these inactive periods, density estimates require
correction.</p>
<p>The correction factor is conceptually straightforward. If animals are
active and available for detection only a proportion <strong>a</strong>
of the day, the raw density estimate <strong>D</strong> overestimates
true density by a factor of 1/<strong>a</strong>. The corrected density
estimate becomes: <span class="math inline">\(D{c} = D \times
\frac{1}{a}\)</span></p>
<p>Determining activity level <strong>a</strong> requires careful
analysis of detection timing patterns. The proportion of time animals
are active is calculated from the temporal distribution of detection
events across the full 24-hour cycle. This analysis assumes that when
animals are active, they are equally likely to be detected at any time
during the active period.</p>
