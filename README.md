## maimer
*'maimer'* is an R package that provides tools to edit, extract, and manage camera metadata seamlessly, and analyze/visualize data, streamlining workflows.

## **Key Features:**
   - ‚úèÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏è Edit metadata fields directly within R through [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) or using the integrated Graphical User Interface (GUI) without requiring extensive coding knowledge.s
   - üóÇÔ∏è Batch editing capabilities to modify metadata for multiple files simultaneously.  
   - üñºÔ∏è Extract metadata, including timestamps, GPS coordinates (if available), camera settings, and more from various image and video formats commonly used in camera traps.  
   - etc.

![Maimer App User Interface](https://github.com/stangandaho/maimer/blob/main/app_interface.jpg?raw=true)


The functions are designed to work well with other R packages such as 
[camtrapR](https://github.com/jniedballa/camtrapR), [overlap](https://github.com/mikemeredith/overlap), etc. for further processing and analysis.


## **Installation:**
You can install 'maimer' directly from GitHub using the following command:

```R
# Install devtools package if you haven't already
if(!'devtools' %in% rownames(installed.packages())){
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install maimer from GitHub
devtools::install_github("stangandaho/maimer")
```

Once installed, *'maimer'* can be loaded and used in R scripts or through the GUI. For consistency and understanbaility, the most package function name started by mm_* . Here‚Äôs a simple example to get started:

```R
# Load the maimer package
library(maimer)

# Example: Extract metadata from a camera trap image
metadata <- mm_get_metadata("path/to/image.jpg")
head(metadata)

# Example: Add field to metadata
mm_create_hs(path = image_path, value = c("Species" = "Vulture"))

# Launch the GUI
mm_app()
```
